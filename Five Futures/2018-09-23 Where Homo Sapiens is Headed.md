# Where Homo Sapiens is Headed

**newsletter:** Five Futures (vol. 2, iss. 6)  
**date:** 2018-09-23

## Prologue

Another huge gap in newsletters, another change in format. The last iteration of Five Futures was an ambitious attempt to push me to write something more original. I still like the idea of doing serialized essays, and will probably attempt it again at some point. But right now I just need to write, to get something out there. And that something needs to be relatively easy to put together, because the day job isn't helping in the time-management department right now.

So here's a bit of an experiment‚Ä¶ Shorter takes (occassionally paired with emoji, Azeem Azhar style), arranged into five broad narrative arcs. Each arc is less a story of the future, and more a sense, a feeling, of a current in the present. Less Pythia in the Temple of Apollo, and more Ozymandias and his wall of TVs.

Anyway, that's the idea at least. Let's see how well it works.

## Chapter 1

üê≥ Whales. Why are they so big?

* [Why Whales Got So Big](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/why-whales-got-so-big/557213/)

More evidence that the Amazon basin was densely populated before European arrival, and that the "primeval" rain forest that exists today is actually nothing of the sort.

* [Parts of the Amazon thought uninhabited were actually home to up to a million people](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-amazon-thought-uninhabited-home-million.html)

üåæ Modern industrial agriculture has drastically decreased the price of food. It's also made it less nutritious.

* [Dirt Poor: Have Fruits and Vegetables Become Less Nutritious?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/)

üöú Industrial agriculture has also been a significant factor in the hollowing out of small-town America.

* [Rural Kansas is dying. I drove 1,800 miles to find out why](https://thecounter.org/rural-kansas-depopulation-commodity-agriculture/)

üíß The Colorado River has been over-used for a long time, and the tensions between the states that depend on it are starting to boil over.

* [The water war that will decide the fate of 1 in 8 Americans](https://grist.org/article/the-water-war-that-will-decide-the-fate-of-1-in-8-americans/)

‚ùÑ Both the Eastern and Western Antarctic ice sheets are now shrinking, and the physics of melting ice means that it's the East Coast of the United States that will be hardest hit.

* [After Decades of Losing Ice, Antarctica Is Now Hemorrhaging It](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/after-decades-of-ice-loss-antarctica-is-now-hemorrhaging-mass/562748/)

The chances of the world keeping global warming below 1.5¬∞ C is, at this point, vanishingly small‚Ä¶ But it's not yet zero.

* [What genuine, no-bullshit ambition on climate change would look like](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/7/17306008/global-warming-climate-change-scenarios-ambition)

üè≠ Burning fossil fuels does more than warm the planet, however - it also impacts human health in a variety of other ways. The new EPA "clean power" plan ignores these effects, and by their own estimates will cause thousands of premature deaths.

* [EPA analysis of its own new climate proposal: thousands of people will die](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17763916/epa-clean-power-plan-affordable-clean-energy)

üè¶ At least Bank of the West is divesting from fossil fuels. Wyoming is *not* happy about it.

* [Bank of the West's environmental stand faces blowback](https://apnews.com/0e7d1b7aad3b4a4c994c89893c02e3e7)

The political case for restricting fossil fuel extraction.

* [It's time to think seriously about cutting off the supply of fossil fuels](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/4/3/17187606/fossil-fuel-supply)

California governor Jerry Brown is one of the US's indisputable leaders in the fight to stop global warming. He's also not doing nearly enough.

* [Jerry Brown vs. the Climate Wreckers: Is He Doing Enough?](https://www.thenation.com/article/jerry-brown-vs-the-climate-wreckers-is-he-doing-enough/)

Ozone-destroying CFCs emissions have spiked in recent years, after decades of decline. The culprit appears to be China's barely-regulated construction industry.

* [Where have all our insects gone?](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/17/where-have-insects-gone-climate-change-population-decline)

A newly discovered section from "The Epic of Gilgamesh" gives the story a surprisingly ecological twist.

## Chapter 2

üíª The definitive timeline of Russia's hacking of the DNC, the Clinton presidential campaign, and local governments is a useful "birds-eye" view of the 2016 information operations. If you work in politics these are now the *baseline* threats you need to be guarding against.

* [Mueller's timeline: How the Russian hacks unfolded](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/mueller-russia-hacks-timeline-686521)

So far Russian information operations related to the 2018 US mid-terms seem to be relatively quiet. But "relatively quiet" is *not* the same as absent.

* [We have the first documented case of Russian hacking in the 2018 election](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/26/17619818/russia-claire-mccaskill-2018-midterm-hack)

One place where Russia is still active is in *organizing* protests. But that doesn't mean that the protests are "fake".

* [Fake news evolved into fake events, and the consequences are scary](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17646302/fake-events-facebook-russia-influence-campaign-free-speech)

The story of misinformation on social media isn't just about Russian trolls, however. It's ordinary people who make "fake news" and conspiracy theories go viral.

* [The Grim Conclusions of the Largest-Ever Study of Fake News](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/largest-study-ever-fake-news-mit-twitter/555104/)

üì∫ You know what's also spreading conspiracy theories? YouTube Kids.

* [The YouTube Kids app has been suggesting a load of conspiracy videos to children](https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-suggested-conspiracy-videos-to-children-using-its-kids-app-2018-3)

üì∞ Revitalizing local news has been seen by some as a way of innoculating US society against weaponized misinformation. After all, the reasoning goes, Americans trust local news more than national news‚Ä¶ Which is something the Russians realize too.

* [Russian Influence Campaign Sought To Exploit Americans' Trust In Local News](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628085238/russian-influence-campaign-sought-to-exploit-americans-trust-in-local-news)

Another proposed solution to the spread of misinformation on social media is the promotion of "media literacy". But simply encouraging a critical approach to the media could actually make things worse.

* [You Think You Want Media Literacy‚Ä¶ Do You?](https://points.datasociety.net/you-think-you-want-media-literacy-do-you-7cad6af18ec2)

Tribalism has played a major role in 20th Century conflicts around the world. The economic dynamics of the US in the 21st Century are making tribal conflicts more likely here as well.

* [Tribal World](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-06-14/tribal-world)

Cultural identity is a more important factor in political alignment on the right than the left, at least within the US.

* [How Republicans embraced identity politics](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/03/22/how-republicans-embraced-identity-politics)

üé• Deep fakes, the mythic film "Shazaam", and the collapse of consensus reality.

* [We're underestimating the mind-warping potential of fake video](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/20/17109764/deepfake-ai-false-memory-psychology-mandela-effect)

Italian politics has always looked weird to outsiders. Is the country's most recent government just another example of Italy being Italy, or a portent of things to come?

* [Italy's weird technopopulism could be the new normal](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/conte-italy-italia-new-government-prime-minister-technopopulism)

## Chapter 3

Diversity increases conflict and makes people uncomfortable‚Ä¶ And that's a good thing.

* [Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable - and That's Why They Perform Better](https://hbr.org/2016/09/diverse-teams-feel-less-comfortable-and-thats-why-they-perform-better)

It might be even better, except that white men all but sabotage their coworkers when women or non-whites are their boss.

* [White Male Workers Respond Poorly To Women And Racial Minorities In Power And Take It Out On Colleagues: Report](https://www.newsweek.com/white-men-react-poorly-women-and-minorities-power-positions-study-finds-839862)

üè° Think that white flight is a thing of the past? Think again.

üìû In New York City, "quality of life" complaints are a weapon of gentrification.

* [They Played Dominoes Outside Their Apartment For Decades. Then The White People Moved In And Police Started Showing Up.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lamvo/gentrification-complaints-311-new-york)

üöó Parking requirements in many US cities are making housing less affordable.

* [In Some US Cities, There Are Over Ten Times More Parking Spaces Than Households](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3epmm/parking-spots-outnumber-homes-us-cities)

üí≤ \#Occupy made the idea of class warfare fashionable again. But if you look at the numbers, it's less about the top 1% vs. the bottom 99%, but rather the top 10% vs. the bottom 90%. And that extra 9.9% holds a lot of people who like to think of themselves as "middle class".

* [The Birth of the New American Aristocracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/)

üìâ It turns out that US manufacturing really *is* imploding, but the way we aggregate economic data has hidden the decline.

* [The epic mistake about manufacturing that's cost Americans millions of jobs](https://qz.com/1269172/the-epic-mistake-about-manufacturing-thats-cost-americans-millions-of-jobs/)

‚õ™ The modern GOP is a party that melds corporate interests with conservative Christianity. It's a political match that was largely masterminded by a single radical clergyman.

üî´ In the US, just 3% of the population owns half of the nation's guns. An that 3% fits a very specific profile.

* [Why Are White Men Stockpiling Guns?](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-are-white-men-stockpiling-guns/)

The old are more likely to be Republicans and the young Democrats, but that has less to do with how our opinions change with age and more to do with the fact that Democrats die young.

üëÆ "Predictive policing" software likes to sell itself as "broken windows policing" for the 21st Century. Which is probably a more accurate analogy than its supporters would care to admit.

Believe in that gun ownership is important? Angry at government over-reach? Written an inflammatory Facebook post in the heat of the moment? Then the FBI might be getting ready to bust you as a domestic terrorist‚Ä¶ But only if you're black.

Violence traumatizes not just those involved and their families, but also their entire community. Unsurprisingly, this remains true when that violence is inflicted by representatives of the state.

Many on the left were disturbed and enraged when the Trump Administration began separating children of undocumented immigrants from their parents. But the same thing has been happening for decades to US citizens as well.

* [Family Separation Goes Beyond Trump's Immigration Plan](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-18/family-separation-goes-beyond-trump-s-immigration-plan)

üè´ Normally when we talk about the "school-to-prison pipeline", we're referring to the increasing entaglement of schools with their local police departments, and the way that this law enforcement presence is predominantly focused on non-white children. Sometimes this process can be shockingly explicit.

## Chapter 5

For most insects, an infection with cordyceps fungi means gradually slipping into a zombie-like state followed by a gruesome "Aliens"-like death. But for cicadas, cordyceps is what keeps them alive.

Should a spider's web be considered part of its mind?

üëΩ The most famous back-of-the-envelope method of estimating how many other intelligent species exist is called the Drake Equation, and even plugging conservative numbers into it suggests that the universe should be filled with alien civilizations. This has lead to the "Fermi Paradox" - if alien civilizations are so common, then why have we seen no evidence for them? It turns out, however, that treating the Drake Equation probabilisticly dissolves the Fermi Paradox: We are likely to be alone in our galaxy, and there's a good chance that we are in fact the only intelligent species in the entire observable universe.

## Epilogue

Originally I was going to write something longer and more conteplative here, but it's been almost exactly a week since I started writing this and I'm basically out of steam right now. Mind you, I haven't added any new articles to this list during that time - it just took me that long to review, sort, and trim down the list of interesting links I accumulated over the last six months. I'm going to experiment on building up future newsletters slowly over the course of a week or two, a little bit each day, and see how that works.

Until next time‚Ä¶
